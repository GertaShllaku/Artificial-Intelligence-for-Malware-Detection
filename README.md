# Malware-Detection-Technique-using-Machine-Learning

This is an AI tool to detect malware in Python.
This approach detects malware by extracting all the features from log files through NLP, specifically Bag-of-Words technique.
Next step of the project is feature analyses through artificial neural networks.
As an output result it will produce true features extracted from the dataset and predicted results, and accuracy, precision, recall of this prediction.
